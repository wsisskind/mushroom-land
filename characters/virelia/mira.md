## History

Mira was born right around the founding of Arlen's Gate. Her family - consisting of her mother Raya, her father Joseph, and her olders brothers Rico and Samuel - had originally lived in northern New Jersey, but were displaced by wildfires shortly before Mira's birth. Therefore, she was born in a Hoboken hostel's medical wing, and grew up in poor and crowded conditions while her family tried to find a new home. 

The family eventually moved to an apartment building in the Hudson Valley, where enthusiasts of the post-scarcity movement (which would later become known as the Ghost movement) resided. Residents of the building helped care for Mira and her brothers and taught her multiple instruments, including guitar, ukulele, and banjo. Mira therefore took an interest in folk music, and dedicated herself to mastering the classics as well as writing her own songs. In her teen years, some of her music became shared across multiple chat channels.

At 18, after attempting to help support her family with a series of odd service jobs, Mira decided to leave home and explore the rest of the United States. She became known for appearing at hostels to play her music, and during this time she gained knowledge about the Ghost movement. Later on in her travels, she met up with Kavi, whose research into the faults of Arlen's Gate led her to become a founding member of the team responsible for setting up the Virelia commune. Mira therefore traveled with Kavi, and was present for the official opening ritual of Virelia in the early 2070s.

Mira became Virelia's main cultural leader, sharing her music and stories and acting as a general emotional guide for the commune. Eventually, she took on a permanent (although voluntary) role as caretaker for Liora, the commune archivist at the time, who had become permanently meshed with the local Ghost after attempting to stop the Delta Scare.

## Key Relationships
- **Liora** — Romantic fling until Liora becomes meshed with the Ghost network, after which Mira becomes her caretaker.
- **Kavi** - Friends and colleagues who were among the first residents of the Virelia commune; a slight romantic fling echoes through their friendship.
- **Elder Sera** - Advisor/advisee relationship.
- **Darin** — Very cold relationship, although they are colleagues; Darin's theories cause Mira to feel a bad vibe.
- **Jun** - Distant relationship; Mira knows Jun and has no hard feelings, but the two of them rarely interact outside of group settings.
- **Jashan** - Friendly and familiar, as Jashan and Mira were both among the first residents of the Virelia commune.
