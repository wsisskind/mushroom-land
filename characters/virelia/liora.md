# Liora

**Role** — Archivist responsible for managing documentation of all kinds related to Virelia, including the history of the Ghost era and all previous and current information regarding culture, art, music, and inklings of news from the rest of the non-Ghost world.  
**Appearance** — Average height, lithe, dark brown hair, bright hazel eyes. A birthmark on her right shoulder which looks like a feather; her father Rian (who worked at Arlen's Gate and was never found after the Grey Bloom) had the same mark.  
**Personality** — Thoughtful and introspective, Liora carries a quiet confidence. She is deeply empathetic, with an almost meditative connection to the living network she tends. A natural mediator, she approaches challenges with patience and a steady calm, always listening before acting. Though soft-spoken, her presence is steady and grounding for those around her.
**Favorites** — Loves early mornings and the stillness before the commune fully wakes; favors simple herbal infusions, especially chamomile and mint blends; enjoys weaving new knot patterns as a form of creative expression; carries a small, worn notebook filled with sketches and reflections on mycelial growth.

## History

Liora was born three years before the Grey Bloom. Her father Rian worked in Arlen's Gate as a pioneer for the Knot system, and her mother Anika was a journalist covering Arlen's Gate and its effect on society as a whole. Liora's father commuted back and forth between the family home in Central New York to Arlen's Gate in the Hudson Valley. When the Grey Bloom occurred, search and rescue teams found no sign of Liora's father within Arlen's Gate's ruins, and his whereabouts remain unknown. 

Her father's supposed death caused Liora to become infatuated with his research, and as she grew older, she became more intent on joining any new commune that started, against her mother's warnings. The opportunity arrived when Virelia sprung up in the Green Mountains of Vermont. She reached out to Kavi (who was running communications at the time) and found that the commune already had someone working on implementing her father's Knot technology: Darin, who had followed the science as a young engineer. The advisor of the commune, Elder Sera, put Liora to work with Darin, as Liora's firsthand documentation was essential to helping Virelia utilize Knot technology faster and better. During this time, a romance formed between Liora and Darin; however, professional differences got in the way. Darin believed they needed to think outside the box to continue to improve Knot technology, while Liora had documentation from her father stating why any deviation from his findings would result in tragedy. 

Elder Sera noticed this fracturing of relations between Liora and Darin, and therefore moved Liora to work as the commune's archivist. About three months after this shift, Liora experienced serious mental and physical issues as a result of the Delta Scare. Her more intense reactions to Delta's effects stemmed from her grandmother's work as an early AI researcher and colleague at Peas Eddy. When the effects of Delta threatened the existence of Virelia and the outside world, Liora found a way to link herself to not just the local Ghost of Virelia, but also the mycelial network at large and what existed of the greater Internet. While this caused Delta to subside (but not delete for good), Liora became permanently embedded with the Ghost, and must now remain Knotted to the network in order to survive.

## Key Relationships
- **Mira** — Romantic fling, and then caretaker when Liora becomes meshed with the Ghost network.
- **Darin** — Teammate working with her on Knot technology implemention, then romantic partner. Post-breakup, Darin remains a friend, but their relationship turns colder and their ideologies become different regarding Knots.
- **Elder Sera** - Advisor/advisee relationship, with a bit of a familiar air.
- **Kavi** - Friends and colleagues. Kavi acts almost as an older sister to Liora, having brought her into the commune.
- **Jun** - Distant relationship; Jun's aloofness rubs Liora the wrong way, although Jun means well.
- **Jashan** - Friendly, but also very dependent, as Jashan is a scavenger who collects materials which Liora needs to work.
