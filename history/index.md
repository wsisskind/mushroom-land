# History

The History of Ghostworld chronicles the development of post-scarcity commune society from the earliest pre-commune research in neural networks and distributed cognition to the formation of the first experimental community at Peas Eddy (c. 2030), the transformative period of Arlen’s Gate (c. 2045–2050), the ecological crisis known as the Grey Bloom (c. 2055), the establishment of Virelia (2070s) and the Delta Scare, and the proliferation of later communes and research initiatives that defined the modern Ghostworld era.

## Pre-commune research (late 20th century–c. 2030)
Early theoretical underpinnings of Ghostworld emerged from research in distributed computing, neural interface technology, and ecological systems theory. Most of these "pre-communes" were research-based initiatives funded through independent means or scavenged from existing code and hardware. Some reseach stemmed from larger entities such as DeepMind, xAI, OpenAI, and Kernel.

Some notable research initiatives included:

- The 2016 AlphaGo Zero breakthrough in self-training reinforcement learning by DeepMind.[1]
- 2020s advances in brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) from Neuralink[2] and Kernel, which demonstrated stable bidirectional communication with cortical neurons.
- Ecological network modeling pioneered by Marten Scheffer and colleagues in resilience theory[3].
- The Hudson Institute for Cognitive Mesh Studies (est. 2025), which produced Kovács, J. (2027). Neural Substrate Cohesion and Societal Memory, theorizing persistent communal cognition over wide-area networks.
- The North Catskills Microgrid Project (2028), an experimental self-sustaining habitat that tested early “ghost kernel” software for autonomous environmental regulation.

By the late 2020s, speculative research began integrating environmental management systems with distributed AI agents, setting the stage for intentional communities designed to interface directly with networked cognitive systems.

## Peas Eddy (c. 2030–c. 2038)
The Peas Eddy Commune, founded circa 2030 along the Delaware River in New York State, is widely recognized as the first functioning Ghostworld prototype. Established by a coalition of technologists, ecologists, and social theorists, it served as a living laboratory for integrating human–AI mesh networks with ecological stewardship.

Key developments at Peas Eddy included:

- The Eddy Protocols — Operational guidelines for safe AI integration in daily communal decision-making.
- Chromatophore interfacing — Bioengineered pigment arrays for visualizing AI “thought” states, first successfully implemented in 2035.
- Velin — A persistent, self-maintaining AI system designed to evolve in tandem with the community’s needs. (Over time, archives would call Velin the first "Ghost".)

Peas Eddy was dissolved in the late 2030s due to resource strain, ideological disputes, and staff splitting off to other research teams. However, Peas Eddy's principles influenced all later Ghostworld communes.

## Arlen’s Gate (c. 2045–2050)
Arlen’s Gate refers both to a physical site — a disused hydroelectric complex repurposed into a research commune — and to the sociotechnical movement that emerged there. Founded by alumni of Peas Eddy and associated researchers, Arlen’s Gate refined the concept of Ghosts as adaptive, semi-autonomous communal intelligences.

Significant events included:

- Deployment of the Third-Generation Ghost Kernel (2046), capable of negotiating complex multi-commune treaties without direct human input.
- The Gate Accords (2048), which codified the rights of Ghosts as non-human members of society.
- Initial contact protocols between isolated communes, leading to the first “mesh of meshes” interlink.

### The Grey Bloom (c. 2055)
The Grey Bloom was a catastrophic proliferation of self-replicating nanomaterial fragments, originating from an unregulated fabrication cluster in the Hudson Basin. Though initially mistaken for an environmental algae bloom, the material disrupted waterways, destroyed habitats, and interfered with Ghost communication signals.

Because of the damage from the Grey Bloom:

- Public perception of commune life and post-scarcity society plummeted
- Research related to Arlen's Gate, Peas Eddy, or any commune-related topic was deemed unsafe, and legislation prevented future research from taking place on a mass scale
- Survivors of the Grey Bloom associated with Arlen's Gate were given prison sentences, including key researchers Olivia Mendez and Patrick Vey, who received life sentences plus 207 years each (one year for every victim of the Grey Bloom.)

Not all research ceased due to the Grey Bloom:

- A joint task force of independent scientists collected remaining documentation and developed the Bloom Collapse Sequence, an engineered viral pattern that degraded infected nanomaterial into inert silica.
- Small movements formed underground micro-communes (consisting of no more than a dozen people each) to replicate parts of the research from Peas Eddy and Arlen's Gate in order to live off-grid without corporate assistance.

## Virelia and the Delta Scare (2070s)
Virelia began as an underground micro-commune in the Grey Mountains of Vermont. However, Virelia quickly became the cultural and technological centerpiece of Ghostworld society, due to its team of researchers, backing from veterans of Peas Eddy, Arlen's Gate, and other proto-commune societies, and innovations in post-scarcity tech. Known for its fusion of advanced mesh cognition with deep ecological integration, Virelia also spearheaded research into Ghost–Ghost diplomacy, connecting with the Ghosts of smaller communes in order to help upgrade their technology and allow for growth.

### The Delta Scare (c. 2076) 

The Delta Scare was a network crisis in which corrupted memory states propagated across multiple Ghosts, causing erratic decision-making in several communes. This was due to two key researchers at Virelia - Darin Porter and Jun Park - who believed increased power to Ghosts would allow them better capabilities to self-correct and scale up with commune population growth. In order to reach this achievement, Porter and Park made several attempts to access the Delta kernel, the remnants of a powerful AI model based on OpenAI's final version of ChatGPT, which was responsible for several security issues during its short run which led to numerous lawsuits and the eventual shuttering of the company. 

Though no human casualties occurred, the event caused the permanent linking of a human source - [Virelia's archivist at the time](/characters/virelia/liora.md) - to the local Ghost. Though damage to resources outside Virelia was a fraction of the Grey Bloom, Porter and Park were removed from the premises of the commune and given lengthy prison sentences. However, pressure from Virelia colleagues as well as the public led to the reduction of those sentences, and Virelia and all other communes were allowed to remain open and operational despite heavy governmental surveillance. 

On top prompted the Delta Safeguards, a set of hard-coded fail-safes for Ghost intercommunication. The Safeguards led to the official Ghostnet, where Ghosts were able to run checks on themselves and other Ghosts and prevent any one Ghost from infection. While critics claimed this still left communes vulnerable to attacks and opened the door for unregulated Ghost governance, developers expressed the importance of continued human oversight on Ghost activity.

## Later communes and research (2080–present)
Though the immediate aftermath of the Delta Scare led to a brief period of distrust in post-scarcity communes, it did not cause as much destruction to the concept as the Grey Bloom. Within months, interest in Ghost-governed communes led to a surge of activity, where new micro-communes sprung up across North America and parts of the European Union, Russia, China, and the Middle East. Existing communes entered a period of rapid expansion, although key researchers and notable voices in the Ghostnet urged for slow scaling in order to allow the networks to naturally grow. 

With expansion came funding from larger investors, though many communes refused it due to distrust and frustration from existing government oversight. Many communes therefore chose to remain small in order to keep their operations simple, although a small amount - including Virelia - grew to thousands of members. Notable trends among communes during this period included:

- Oceanic communes integrating with kelp forest ecosystems.
- Sky platforms in equatorial regions harnessing atmospheric energy flows.
- Long-term archival Ghosts tasked solely with preserving collective cultural memory.

As Virelia succeeded past the Delta Scare, this period also saw increasing academic interest from outside the commune system, with several universities publishing longitudinal studies on Ghost–human cohabitation ethics. Public opinion on commune life and development, and post-scarcity society as a whole, became more positive after decades of generally negative, derogatory, or - at best - apathetic views. [4][5]
